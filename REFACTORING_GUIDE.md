# REFACTORING_GUIDE.md

## Purpose

This guide defines best practices for overhauling the application through **updates, refactorings, and performance improvements**, while ensuring **no existing functionality or features are broken**.

The goal is to keep the codebase **clean, stable, performant, and maintainable** for long-term growth.

---

## Principles

When making changes, follow these core principles:

- **Stability First** → Never break existing features or functionality.  
- **Maintainability** → Prioritize clarity, modularity, and long-term sustainability.  
- **Performance** → Optimize code paths, memory usage, and execution speed without premature optimization.  
- **Best Practices** → Apply **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)**, **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**, and **SOLID** design principles.  
- **Backward Compatibility** → Ensure compatibility unless otherwise specified.  

---

## Workflow

1. **Assessment**  
   - Identify outdated dependencies, bottlenecks, or fragile code.  
   - Document the current state and proposed changes.  

2. **Refactor & Update**  
   - Clean up redundant or messy code.  
   - Upgrade libraries/frameworks to stable, supported versions.  
   - Apply structural improvements for readability and maintainability.  

3. **Optimize Performance**  
   - Reduce unnecessary computations.  
   - Improve memory and resource management.  
   - Apply efficient algorithms and data structures where applicable.  

4. **Testing**  
   - Run all existing test suites after changes.  
   - Add new tests to cover updated/refactored logic.  
   - Validate against regression risks.  

5. **Documentation**  
   - Update inline comments, docstrings, and changelogs.  
   - Record major architectural or performance-related decisions.  

---

## Do’s

- Keep functions and classes **focused and modular**.  
- Write **self-explanatory code**; rely less on comments, more on clarity.  
- Regularly **profile performance** during optimization work.  
- Use **version control effectively** (commit small, meaningful changes).  
- Communicate **breaking changes** if they’re absolutely necessary.  

---

## Don’ts

- Don’t introduce **regressions** or break working features.  
- Don’t over-engineer or complicate simple solutions.  
- Don’t skip testing after refactoring.  
- Don’t update dependencies without checking compatibility.  
- Don’t leave **unexplained changes** undocumented.  

---

## End Goal

A **cleaner, faster, and more maintainable application** that preserves existing functionality while being prepared for future growth.
