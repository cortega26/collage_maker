ID,Severity(S0-S3),Area,Component/Page,Steps to Reproduce,Expected,Actual,Root Cause,Fix,Owner,Effort
QA-01,S0,Performance,Autosave subsystem,Wait for autosave interval while editing captions or dragging images,UI remains responsive during autosave,Window freezes for ~0.1-0.7s and blocks input when autosave runs,AutosaveManager writes large JSON payload synchronously on UI thread and calls time.sleep during retries,Implement background autosave worker that serializes state off the UI thread; replace sleeps with QTimer-based retry scheduling,Engineering Lead,1–2d
QA-02,S1,UX/Undo,Caption styling workflow,Select a cell, adjust font size slider, then press Ctrl+Z,Caption styling changes revert via undo,Undo stack ignores caption size/color toggles so changes persist,Caption updates bypass session_controller.capture_snapshot and baseline updates,Capture undo snapshot before applying caption/style changes and refresh baseline after apply,Front-end Lead,1–2d
QA-03,S1,Security & IO,Add Images dialog,Choose an image using manual path entry such as file:// or unsupported extension,Invalid paths/extensions are rejected with clear message,Application attempts to load path and may hang or crash,File dialog bypasses utils.validation.validate_image_path allowing unsupported schemes/extensions,Validate each selected file with utils.validation.validate_image_path before loading,Back-end Lead,≤2h
QA-04,S1,Security & IO,Save Collage dialog,Type an output path without extension or pointing to non-existent directory,Dialog enforces valid extension and warns about missing directory,File is saved with auto-appended extension; invalid directories trigger confusing errors later,Output path not validated against utils.validation.validate_output_path,Validate selected save path and show actionable error if invalid,Back-end Lead,≤2h
QA-05,S1,Maintainability,Main window controller,Read src/main.py::_export_collage and surrounding helpers,High-level orchestration lives in thin presenters/services,MainWindow owns autosave, IO, dialogs, undo, and worker orchestration in a 900+ line class,Monolithic MainWindow blends UI and business logic,Extract service layer for IO/autosave/export and keep MainWindow focused on wiring,Engineering Lead,1–2w
QA-06,S1,Performance,Export flow with originals enabled,Enable "Save Original" and export a collage with large source images,Export completes within consistent time budget without memory spikes,Original recomposition spikes memory and blocks UI while building giant QImage before worker dispatch,Original recomposition assembles large QImage synchronously before offloading,Stream originals directly to disk or tile composition in worker thread,Engineering Lead,1–2d
QA-07,S1,Accessibility,Caption color controls,Tab through control panel after selecting a cell,Color buttons expose accessible color descriptions and focus order follows grouping,Buttons only announce label without selected color; focus order jumps,Color pickers lack accessible descriptions and grouping semantics,Add accessible descriptions/state announcements and group color controls within focus scope,Front-end Lead,≤2h
QA-08,S2,Architecture,Cache management,Review src/cache.py usage across widgets,Cache replacement strategies injectable per feature/test,Global proxy hides cache lifetime making instrumentation difficult,Dependency injection limited to module-level proxy,Expose explicit cache provider interface and pass instances via constructors where used,Back-end Lead,1–2d
QA-09,S2,Testing,Critical undo/autosave flows,Run pytest focusing on tests/test_mainwindow_session.py,Undo/autosave/caption edge cases covered with deterministic tests,Tests cover session controller but skip caption + color undo and autosave failure cases,Missing regression tests for caption undo, autosave failure retries,MainWindow hard to unit test and lacks spies,Add Qt-less tests for caption undo + autosave error handling using controller seams,QA Lead,1–2d
QA-10,S2,UX Responsiveness,Template presets,Switch templates quickly via combo box while selecting cells,UI applies template or reverts gracefully on invalid input,Silent failure when template parsing fails leaving stale grid,Template handler swallows exceptions and ignores invalid formats,Validate template strings and surface error feedback instead of bare except,Product Owner,≤2h
